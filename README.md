 Data-Driven Analysis of 311 Complaints in New York City**  

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Description**  
This project presents a **comprehensive analysis of 311 complaints in New York City** using advanced **data processing, visualization, and machine learning techniques**. The goal is to uncover patterns in public complaints, identify high-impact areas, and provide actionable insights for government agencies and policymakers to improve city services.  

Through a combination of **data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and predictive modeling**, this project highlights the **most common complaint types, their distribution across NYC boroughs, and the response efficiency of city services**. Additionally, a **machine learning model** is implemented to predict complaint patterns, enabling proactive decision-making.

## **ðŸš€ Key Features & Methodology**  

### ðŸ”¹ **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
- Processed a **311 service request dataset** from NYC.  
- Removed **irrelevant and missing data** (e.g., landmark column, records without key details).  
- Standardized **timestamps** to extract meaningful time-based insights.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Geographical Complaint Distribution**: Identified **Brooklyn** as the most affected borough.  
- **Top Complaint Types**: "HEAT/HOT WATER," "Illegal Parking," and "Noise-Residential" are the most frequent issues.  
- **Hourly Trends**: Complaints peak during **daytime hours**, aligning with work schedules.  
- **Zip Code Analysis**: Pinpointed **10467 & 11226** as high-complaint areas.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Feature Engineering**  
- Created **per-capita complaint rates** using **population and household income** data.  
- Applied **binary encoding** for categorical variables to improve machine learning performance.  
- Implemented **outlier detection** to remove anomalies from the dataset.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Data Visualization with Advanced Techniques**  
- **Heatmaps & Scatter Plots**: Mapped complaint density across NYC.  
- **Bar & Pie Charts**: Displayed top complaint categories & borough-wise analysis.  
- **Hexbin Plots**: Visualized hotspots of frequent complaints.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Machine Learning Modeling**  
- Built a **Random Forest Regression model** to predict complaint volume based on historical data.  
- **Hyperparameter tuning** using **GridSearchCV** to optimize model performance.  
- Achieved **94% accuracy** in predicting complaint-related household income patterns.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Predictive Insights & Actionable Recommendations**  
- **Resource Allocation**: Authorities should **prioritize heating and water issues** in Brooklyn & the Bronx.  
- **Service Efficiency**: Optimized complaint response times using data-driven strategies.  
- **Future Predictions**: Machine learning can forecast complaint volumes to enhance city planning.
